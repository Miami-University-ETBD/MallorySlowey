            <h2>Meet Jill</h2>
            <p> <strong>Jill Slowey</strong>, the heart and hand's behind it all, she is a retired kindergarten teacher who has always had a love for baking. After spending decades teaching and nurturing young minds, she found a joy in sharing her passion for homemade treats with friends, family, and her local community.</p>
        
            <p>Baking started as a simple hobby, but over time, Jill's creations became highly requested by her family at family gatherings and holiday parties. Now, with Jilly Bean Bakery, she continues to spread happiness one cookie at a time! </p>
            <p>People call Jill "Jilly Bean" as a playful, affectionate nickname. It likely comes from the natural rhyme with her name and the sweet, fun connotation of jelly beans, suggesting she's lovable and full of energy.</p>

            <p>At Jilly Bean Bakery, we believe that great baking starts with the best ingredients and a touch of love. <u>Our philosophy is simple</u>: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use fresh, natural ingredients - No artificial preservatives.</li>
                <li>Stick to family recipes passed down through generations.</li>
                <li>Make everything from scratch, ensuring quality.</li>
                <li>Bring joy through delicious, nostalgoc treats that remind you of home.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>Jill still sees baking as a way to bring people together, just like she did in the classroom. Whether it's a batch of cookies for a school bake sales or a warm loaf of banana bread for a neighbor, she pours her heart into every recipe.</p>
